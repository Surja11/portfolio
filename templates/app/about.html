        I am a passionate junior web developer currently studying and growing my skills in backend development.
        I am deeply interested in building web applications with Django, Django Rest Framework, .Net Core and basic frontend with HTML, CSS and JS.
        I enjoy learning how real-world systems are built and constantly improving my understanding of both frontend and backend development.
      </p>
      <p>My journey into tech began when I learnt simple problem solving techniques in computer science back in school. 
    Now, I thrive on turning ideas into functional applications, whether it’s RESTful APIs, database design, 
    or responsive UIs.I’m always eager to learn from the dev community.</p>
